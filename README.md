# Project Description 
HandyPiano comprises itself of OpenCV and Python programming to virtually play a piano, without the real thing. Using computer vision techniques, a user's hands get mapped to correspond with a certain piano key. When a user presses a key with their finger in thin air, a note shall play. This concept would require a camera to point at a pair of hands, identify each hand, finger, and fingertip, then bind it to an octave on a virtual piano.
